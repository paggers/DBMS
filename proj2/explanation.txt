Worked on the project well in advance, we had a good time schedule. By the deadline we were only a couple points shy from 100, so it was not TOO bad, but both my partner and I aren’t satisfied with less than 120 :)

Also this is both of ours first BIG project, so we are still learning how to manage all the tricks in regards to testing and work load ‘sharing’.

Last but not least, we are both taking 3 techs which have projects in a similar time so life hasn’t been too good recently (not too bad either though!).
